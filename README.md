Stat logging for OS X for interesting look at my computer's history over time

You should change hostname to what your computer is called.  The script uses this file because DHCP is sometimes allowed to change the hostname of a computer and that was causing issues with the logging.  If you do end up changing it, you can `git assume` the file to prevent it from showing up in your repo as changed, but that might be unnecessary.  This script is of the information-gathering sort, so it's kind of fire-and-forget.
